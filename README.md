# Version 2 of My Portfolio

## Overview
This repository represents a complete overhaul of my personal portfolio website. It showcases my growth as a developer and highlights the progress I've made since my last commit to the original project. This version is built with modern tools and frameworks to deliver a more dynamic and polished user experience.

## What's New
- Rebuilt from scratch using **React** with server-side rendering.
- Codebase now written in **TypeScript** for better type safety and maintainability.
- Styled with **TailwindCSS** for a modern, responsive, and utility-first design.
- Improved structure and performance compared to the original static website built with Node.js, ExpressJS, and vanilla HTML/CSS.

## Features

* React Server-Side Rendering: Optimized performance.

* TypeScript Integration: Enhanced type checking and code quality.

* TailwindCSS Styling: Sleek, responsive design.

* Dynamic Components: Improved interactivity and user experience.
